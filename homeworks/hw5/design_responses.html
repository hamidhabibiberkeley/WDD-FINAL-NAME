                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I have always looked at different types of UI interactions, and I was honestly pretty blown away by some of these. I think that in the past, I've always put an emphasis on looking at how usable these would be, but with these ones I was able to just look at the beauty of them. I really liked teh vegetable one at the bottom for EasyGrow. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is just being able to see how many different ways UI interactins can be implemented. Not only have they included dynamic pages with different product introductions and really cool entry points. These designs were really inspiring.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> As previously mentioned, I really liked the easygrow app preview. I thought this was a fun way to go about this information, which alot of people my age and yougner would not find interesting. I also liiked the landing page concept that Anton made as it felt fun and playful. I would have felt really inclined to download just based on the energy of that site. </p>
