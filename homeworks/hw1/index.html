        <p>Hello! I'm Hamid, a youthful explorer that has no idea what he's doing with his life. Although I have always been unsure of what I want to do with my life,
            I've started to enjoy spending time taking photos, doing things to bring a smile on my friends faces, and eating more food than I can name.

        <h1>Part 2: Reading Response</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Although I come from a more accessibility oriented design background, I did not know alot of these features existed. I thought the part about composer view on Twitter was really interesting as they make it easier to know you are adding another tweet.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article is that they push the idea of understanding rules to break them. I think it is key to be seasoned in what different design methods are used so we know how to create our own and what we can and can't do. </li>
            <li>" By routinely analyzing other apps, youll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
