						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I have already known about dark design patterns for a while. I was not aware about how much they have grown over the course of the internet. I also was not aware that the many different methods have names. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I like that this article does a good job of making us aware of what we are dealing with. They do a good job of describing and detailing what we should keep an eye out for. I wonder if anyone has created an adblocker like plugin that calls out and points to these dark design patterns.  </p>
