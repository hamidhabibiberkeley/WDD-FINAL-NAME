							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color accessibility is super important in product design, especially when creating accessibile designs. There are many tools available for designers to use so I ought to start checking my contrast ratio and accessibility checks. In the past I have been faced with situations where my design was not entirley accessible and so this was super helpful to see these exist.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The emotional aspect of not creating accessible design was pretty big for me. "It's rude" stood out to me and when there already exists all of these supplementary tools to make sure our designs are accessible, it should be a given that this is a focus of a lot of our work. Accessibility can also be done in cases other than just color like ensuring that other visuals exist to signify things.</p>
