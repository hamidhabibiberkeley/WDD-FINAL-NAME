							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The way that we look at things is heavily influenced by our past experiences or how our memory works. The way we recognize objects based on past experiences is hecka crazy. Things like these are known as Gestalt principles and can be further seen in UI Design. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked seeing moments that I could remember from High School and cloudy days showing up again in UI Design. Principles like similarity principle and common region principle make sense to me since they show the similar experience. I really liked how the images helped to understand the text. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
