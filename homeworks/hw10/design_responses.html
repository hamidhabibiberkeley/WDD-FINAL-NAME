							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>  As a Cognitive Science major, I was really excited to read this article. It was really reassuring that I am on the right path for the proper career that I am looking for (kinda would be too late to change now). Sometimes I am curious though if I am really learning things that are helpful outside of research towards a UX Career. Overall I thought Hick's Law was something that I have seen many times before.</p>
